Fund Photo Mosaic
========================

This project will be a template for a crowdfunding site. On it users will be able to upload images which will then be sliced and hidden. Each piece will be assigned a price for it's uncovering and that is essentially how this funding works.

For now content is static, however implementing it in a proper framework is comming right up. Plans are to use FatFreeFramework, so you might want to familiarize yourself with it.

If you want to test out current content, you can do so by just clicking the links. On login site you can enter admin to access admin control panel (any other username entry will result in user settings).
